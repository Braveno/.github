## Objective

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and non-goals? This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

## Motivation

Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed to show how this design addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports this? What related work exists?

## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe your chosen approach is superior.

Make sure you’ve thought through and addressed the following sections. If a section is not relevant to your specific proposal, please explain why, e.g. your RFC addresses a convention or process, not an API.


### Alternatives Considered
* Make sure to discuss the relative merits of alternatives to your proposal.

### Best Practices
* Does this proposal change best practices for some aspect of using/developing TensorFlow? How will these changes be communicated/enforced?

### User Impact
* What are the user-facing changes? How will this feature be rolled out?

## Detailed Design

This section is optional. Elaborate on details if they’re important to
understanding the design, but would make it hard to read the proposal section
above.

## Questions and Discussion Topics

Seed this with open questions you require feedback on from the RFC process.
